This project is written in C++ for arduino. This code basiccally takes in signals from 5 individual arduinos into a master arduino. I was doing this for the IXDOS mission ship. This project was to monitor the water level in a tank and displays them to a LCD screen. The way I know how much water is in the tank is by using float switches which has 2 states like a button and with a little bit of maths figured out the positions I need to put them. 

This system is very robust as the switches are waterproff compare to using ultrasonic sensors.
